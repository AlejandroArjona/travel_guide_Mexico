                <h3>About this country</h3>
                <p>Colonial cities, Magical Towns and exclusive beaches continue to conquer the hearts of national and international travelers. Traveling is an experience that is always exciting. However, the long period of confinement that we have experienced caused practically all tourist destinations in the country to be closed to visitors for several months. Within the first places were located both colonial cities and the charming Magical Towns. However, the sun and the beach also continue to conquer the desire to spend a few days by the sea. All of them still captivate people willing to pack their clothes in a suitcase and enjoy a vacation with their travel proposal.</p>
